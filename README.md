# Tidy

Tidy is a desktop application created to manage the deletion of all those local branches that have been already merged into a target branch.

So this is a little tool i built in order to keep my local repository clean, since the current workflow in my job is to create a branch per feature and afterwards merge the aforementioned branch into a development branch, we end up having lots of branches laying around in the local repository which is not good.

All you need to do is to add some configuration, in the settings section you have to provide where in the filesystem is laying your repository along with the target branch you wish to know your branches were merged to.
